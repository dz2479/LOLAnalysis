League of Legends, published in 2009, is a team-oriented strategy video game developed by Riot Games. The goal is to work together with your teammates to bring down the enemy nexus located in the middle of their base before your opponents take down yours. Additionally, before bringing down the enemy nexus, there are some towers that you need to destroy first to access the enemy nexus. There are several game modes in League of Legends and we will focus on Summoner’s Rift because most game contests including League of Legends World Championship use this mode. In this mode, in order to bring down the enemy’s nexus, a team of five champions (summoned by players) will classically split into four small parties, which are three parties of one single champion and one party of two champions. There are three lanes and one jungle. One champion will traverse down the top line, which will be called top in the following context. One champion will traverse down the middle line, which will be called mid in the following context. Two champions will traverse down the bottom line, which will be called bot in the following context. The last champion will go into the jungle, which will be called jug in the following context. Normally, this partition is the same for the enemy team. 1.2 Interested Topics We are interested in which aspects of a game have greater influences on winning. More precisely, we are curious about How team’s gold efficiency, vision control, objects control, and gaming strategy impact winning rate. In addition, how players influence gold efficiency and vision control. Besides gold efficiency and vision control, which aspects of a player influence team’s wining rate the most. To answer these questions, we focus on the results of League of Legends World Championship 2021. Before that, let us explain some terms here. Gold Efficiency: Collection of gold. There are several ways to earn gold including kill minions, monsters and enemy champions. Therefore, we can analyze minion killed per minute, gold per minute, gold differential per minute and so on to see whether a gold efficient team is easier to win. Vision Control: Control of wards and vision wards. The map of Summoner’s Rift is invisible when champions are not within a certain range. However, wards and vision wards can be placed to make one area visible to ally team. We wonder how wards and vision wards influence wining rate. Objects Control: Control of jungle monsters including Dragons, Rift Herald and Nash Baron. Different monsters have different effect to champions or to the team. We wonder how theses monsters impact a game. Gaming Strategy: More fights or less fights. We will use kills per game, deathes per game, first blood rate, first tower rate and so on to see how blood degree of a team(fights frequency) affect a game. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Team Stats 2.2 Player Stats 2.3 Data Limitations", " Chapter 2 Data sources The data we use can be directly copied from https://gol.gg/esports/home/ in table form. Since we decided to analyze the team from several aspects, we reorganized the data and categorized columns into different datasets in order to generate desired graphs. We separated the data into five csv files, which are “./data/team_stats.csv”, “./data/top_stats.csv”, “./data//jug_stats.csv”, “./data//mid_stats.csv”, “./data//bot_stats.csv”, “./data//sup_stats.csv”. However, these files do not contain player-team belongings. So we copied player-team belongings data from https://www.wanplus.com/lol/playerstats and seperated into five csv files, which are “./data//top_team.csv”, “./data//jug_team.csv”, “./data//mid_team.csv”, “./data//bot_team.csv”, “./data//sup_team.csv”. For each of above files, there are 16 data rows except top ones(it has 17 rows because GENG has two tops). Let’s then explain some variables: 2.1 Team Stats K.D: Kill to Death ratio GPM: Gold per minute GDM: Gold differential per minute FB.: First blood rate FT.: First tower rate DRAPG: Dragon killed per game DRA.: Dragon control rate HERPG: Rift Herald killed per game HER.: Rift Herald control rate DRA.15: Average dragons at 15 min TD.15: Tower differential at 15 min GD.15: Gold differential at 15 min NASHPG: Baron Nashor killed per game NASH.: Baron Nashor control rate CSM: creeps per minute DPM: damage to champions per minute WPM: Wards per minute VWPM: Vision Wards per minute WCPM: Wards cleared per minute 2.2 Player Stats KDA: (Kill+Assist)/Death CSM: Average CS per minute per game GPM: Average Gold per minute per game KP.: Average Kill Participation per game DMG.: Average share of team’s damage to champions per game DPM: Average damage to champions per minute per game VSPM: Average vision score per minute per game Avg.WPM: Average Wards per minute per game Avg.WCPM: Average Wards cleaered per minute per game Avg.VWPM: Average Vision Wards per minute per game GD.15:Average Gold Differential at 15 min CSD.15: Average CS Differential at 15 min XPD.15:Average XP Differential at 15 min FB..: Firstblood participation (kill or assist) FB.Victim: Firstblood victim percent 2.3 Data Limitations There is one limitation of our data. The version of League of Legends is constantly changing, so the winning strategy for each version is different. The conclusions we got in this project may not be applicable to other versions. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Based on data copied from data sources, we can read it into our project with R function read.csv(). We first read team statistics and rename the team abbreviation. Samples below: ## [1] &quot;100T&quot; &quot;C9&quot; &quot;DFM&quot; &quot;DK&quot; &quot;EDG&quot; &quot;FNC&quot; &quot;FPX&quot; &quot;GENG&quot; &quot;HLE&quot; &quot;LNG&quot; &quot;MAD&quot; &quot;PSG&quot; &quot;RGE&quot; &quot;RNG&quot; &quot;T1&quot; ## [16] &quot;TL&quot; Then we merge teams’ rank into team stats. Samples below: ## Name rank ## 1 100T 16 ## 2 C9 8 ## 3 DFM 16 ## 4 DK 2 ## 5 EDG 1 ## 6 FNC 16 ## 7 FPX 16 ## 8 GENG 4 ## 9 HLE 8 ## 10 LNG 16 ## 11 MAD 8 ## 12 PSG 16 ## 13 RGE 16 ## 14 RNG 8 ## 15 T1 4 ## 16 TL 16 When data was read into R, some data type are all characters. Therefore, we converted data type to the correct one. For better analysis, we transformed variable “Game.Duration” from character to numeric format. Besides, some data ends with % notation. So we removed %, converted it into numeric value. Additionally, there is one column called Region and one value of it is NA, which stands for North America. However, R will count it as unavailable values. Therefore, we transformed this kind of value to NA(North America). Here are samples of our transformed data: ## Name Region Game.duration ## 1 100T NA 34.68 ## 2 C9 NA 35.05 ## 3 DFM JP 31.22 ## 4 DK KR 34.67 ## 5 EDG CN 32.73 ## 6 FNC EUW 37.68 ## 7 FPX CN 33.43 ## 8 GENG KR 36.07 ## 9 HLE KR 35.67 ## 10 LNG CN 31.67 ## 11 MAD EUW 37.07 ## 12 PSG PCS 36.78 ## 13 RGE EUW 37 ## 14 RNG CN 34.28 ## 15 T1 KR 31.03 ## 16 TL NA 33.42 Then we read players’ data into our project but our data does not bind players to their belonging teams. So we add that to our players’ data. We delete pentakill rates and solo kill rates. Other players’ data transformations are almost the same as the transformations of teams’ data.

We have two reasons for choosing this data set: First, our datasets do not have any missing values, and you can check out here: https://data.pentaq.com/TeamStats?tour=82. Second, we are big fans of Marvel Studio so we are passionate to analyze information about avengers. By looking through descriptions of this data set, we can measure mortality rates of 173 current and former avengers. 4.2 Data Resource Let’s first take a glance at the data set. ## [1] &quot;url&quot; &quot;name_alias&quot; &quot;appearances&quot; ## [4] &quot;current&quot; &quot;gender&quot; &quot;probationary_intro&quot; ## [7] &quot;full_reserve_avengers_intro&quot; &quot;year&quot; &quot;years_since_joining&quot; ## [10] &quot;honorary&quot; &quot;death1&quot; &quot;return1&quot; ## [13] &quot;death2&quot; &quot;return2&quot; &quot;death3&quot; ## [16] &quot;return3&quot; &quot;death4&quot; &quot;return4&quot; ## [19] &quot;death5&quot; &quot;return5&quot; &quot;notes&quot; Here are explanations of the column variables: url: The URL of the comic character on the Marvel Wikia name_alias: The full name or alias of the character, which will be abbreviated as “nm_l” appearances:The number of comic books that character appeared in as of April 30, which will be abbreviated as “appr” current: Is the member currently active on an avengers affiliated team?, which will be abbreviated as “crrn” gender: The recorded gender of the character, which will be abbreviated as “gndr” probationary_intro: Sometimes the character was given probationary status as an Avenger, this is the date that happened, which will be abbreviated as “prob_” full_reserve_avengers_intro: The month and year the character was introduced as a full or reserve member of the Avengers, which will be abbreviated as \"f___\" year: The year the character was introduced as a full or reserve member of the Avengers years_since_joining: 2015 minus the year, which will be abbreviated as \"yr__\" honorary: The status of the avenger, if they were given “Honorary” Avenger status, if they are simply in the “Academy,” or “Full” otherwise, which will be abbreviated as “hnrr” death1: TRUE if the Avenger died, FALSE if not, which will be abbreviated as “dth1” return1: TRUE if the Avenger returned from their first death, FALSE if they did not, blank if not applicable, which will be abbreviated as “rtr1” death2: TRUE if the Avenger died a second time after their revival, FALSE if they did not, blank if not applicable, which will be abbreviated as “dth2” return2: TRUE if the Avenger returned from their second death, FALSE if they did not, blank if not applicable, which will be abbreviated as “rtr2” death3: TRUE if the Avenger died a third time after their second revival, FALSE if they did not, blank if not applicable, which will be abbreviated as “dth3” return3: TRUE if the Avenger returned from their third death, FALSE if they did not, blank if not applicable, which will be abbreviated as “rtr3” death4: TRUE if the Avenger died a fourth time after their third revival, FALSE if they did not, blank if not applicable, which will be abbreviated as “dth4” return4: TRUE if the Avenger returned from their fourth death, FALSE if they did not, blank if not applicable, which will be abbreviated as “rtr4” death5: TRUE if the Avenger died a fifth time after their fourth revival, FALSE if they did not, blank if not applicable, which will be abbreviated as “dth5” return5: TRUE if the Avenger returned from their fifth death, FALSE if they did not, blank if not applicable, which will be abbreviated as “rtr5” notes: Descriptions of deaths and resurrections 4.3 Missing Patterns Let’s create some missing plots to see some partterns of the “avengers” data set. Now we observed some missing patterns. From the top graph: We observed that every comic character of this data set has an url on the Marvel Wikia and appears somewhere once in comic books as of April 30(appr); most of them have full name or alias while some does not(nm_l). Additionally, they all joined the Avengers before (year &amp; yr__) and their current status on any avengers affiliated teams are recorded(crnn). More precisely, most of them joined the Avengers directly, which means they were not given probationary status as an Avenger(prb_). However, there are some cases that we do not know the month the character was introduced as a full or reserve member of the Avengers(f___). Their gender and honorary status(gndr &amp; hnrr) are also recorded in this data set. Moreover, this data set documented whether every one of them died once or not(dth1) for all comic characters and even recorded whether some comic characters returned from their first death(rtr1). For some comic characters died once, we know descriptions of their deaths and resurrections(nots). In addition, for most comic characters in this data set, we do not know whether they died more than once and whether they returned more than once. There are a few cases that we know whether some characters died after their first return from their first death and we know whether they returned from their second death. For all comic characters in this data set except Mar-Vell and Jocasta, we do not know whether they died more than twice or not and whether they returned more than twice or not. Here are their information except the “notes:” information. ## row1 ## url http://marvel.wikia.com/Mar-Vell_(Earth-616)# ## name_alias Mar-Vell ## appearances 254 ## current FALSE ## gender MALE ## probationary_intro NA ## full_reserve_avengers_intro Jul-78 ## year 1978 ## years_since_joining 37 ## honorary Full ## death1 TRUE ## return1 TRUE ## death2 TRUE ## return2 TRUE ## death3 TRUE ## return3 FALSE ## death4 NA ## return4 NA ## death5 NA ## return5 NA ## row2 ## url http://marvel.wikia.com/Jocasta_(Earth-616)# ## name_alias Jocasta ## appearances 141 ## current TRUE ## gender FEMALE ## probationary_intro Jul-80 ## full_reserve_avengers_intro Nov-88 ## year 1988 ## years_since_joining 27 ## honorary Full ## death1 TRUE ## return1 TRUE ## death2 TRUE ## return2 TRUE ## death3 TRUE ## return3 TRUE ## death4 TRUE ## return4 TRUE ## death5 TRUE ## return5 TRUE From the bottom two graphs, we can further observe the missing patterns: For around 85 comic characters in this data set, we don’t know whether they returned from their first death or how they died for the first time. As a result, we don’t know the stories including deaths and returns after their first death. (pattern 1, 4, 6, 9, 14) For around 40 comic characters in this data set, we do know whether they returned from their first death and how they died for the first time, but we still don’t know the stories after their first return if they had. (pattern 2, 5, 8) For around 10 comic characters in this data set, we know whether they died second time or returned second time, but not after that. (pattern 3, 11, 15, 16) Like we observed before, only one comic character does not have any missing values. (pattern 10) For most comic characters in this data set, we don’t know their when they were given probationary status as an Avenger. (pattern 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16) "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Influence of Gold Efficiency to Winning Rate 5.2 Influence of Vision Control to Winning Rate 5.3 Influence of Objects Control to Winning Rate 5.4 Influence of Gaming Strategy to Winning Rate 5.5 Influence of Players to Winning Rate 5.6 Correlation of Different Variables", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Influence of Gold Efficiency to Winning Rate For this analysis, we will use GD.15: gold differential at 15 minutes GPM: gold per minute CSM: creeps per minute to measure gold efficiency. This graph is ordered by winning rates, in which top teams have higher winning rate(all bar charts below have same name order). We normalized the data for better view of some differences between each team. From the above graph, we noticed that GPM and GD.15 are very important to a team’s winning rate because teams with highest winning rate including DK, T1, GENG, EDG, RNG all have high GPM and GD.15. DFM has the lowest GPM and GD.15 so we now know why it has the lowest winning rate. From this graph, we noticed that the contribution to team’s GD.15 of five positions does not have a common pattern for all teams. Therefore, we cannot tell which position contributes most but there are some features for some teams. For example, for teams like PSG and 100T, their GD.15 comes most from bot and top. For teams like FPX, MAD, HLE, and T1, their GD.15 comes least from jug. On the other hand, the contribution to team’s GPM of five positions does have a common pattern for all teams. We can see that GPM comes least from sup. For rest positions, it’s about the same. We can conclude all team members are important to the team. In general, GD.15 and GPM are really important to teams’ winning rate. Different player contributes differently to GD.15 but contributes almost same to GPM(equally important). 5.2 Influence of Vision Control to Winning Rate For this analysis, we will use WPM: Wards per minute VWPM: Vision wards per minute WCPM: Wards cleared per minute to measure vision control as described in introduction. From the above graph, we can see that DK which has the highest winning rate controls vision very great. We also found one fact that LCK teams has the best vision control among all other teams: all four teams from Korean has positive vision scores. From these three graphs, we cannot tell vision control plays a crucial role in winning rate. However, let’s still look at the contribution to vision control of different positions. From above graphs, we can clearly see that sup contributes most to team’s vision control in all three WPM, VWPM, and WCPM. The second is jug. 5.3 Influence of Objects Control to Winning Rate For this analysis, we will use DRAPG: Dragon killed per game DRA.: Dragon control percent NASHPG: Nash Baron killed per game NASH.: Nash Baron control percent HERPG: Rift Herald killed per game HER.: Rift Herald control percent to measure objects control. The reason for choosing these three monsters is that they often provoke fights between two teams. We want to know why the two teams compete for those monsters. As a result, from the above six graphs, we can conclude that controlling more Dragons and Nash Barons is crucial in winning a game. The top 5 winning teams have high controls of Dragon and Nash Baron while the bot 5 winning teams always lose them. However, it is not obvious that controlling more Rift Herald will make one team easier to win. Teams like HLE, MAD, C9, FPX and FNC controls lots of Rift Herald but they have relatively low wining rate. 5.4 Influence of Gaming Strategy to Winning Rate We will measure the blood degree of teams by using Kills…game: Kills of team per game Deaths…game: Deathes of team per game FB.: First blood rate Towers.killed: Towers killed per game Towers.lost: Towers lost per game FT.: First tower rate For above variables, the higher they are, the bloody a team is This graph is ordered by winning rate, in which left teams have higher winning rate(same for all line graphs below). From kills and deaths perspective, except FNC, all other teams have almost same kills and deaths. Additionally, their first blood rate does not differ much. Therefore, the degree of blood of different teams from this view is about the same. However, this graph shows that if one team have less deaths, they will be easier to win. From towers killed and lost perspective, if one team has more towers killed, higher first tower rate, and less towers lost, it will have a higher winning rate. Therefore, combined with kills and deaths perspective, if a team is more defensive, which means that they have less deaths and lose less towers, they gain victory easier. 5.5 Influence of Players to Winning Rate For this analysis, we want to know how each postion, i.e., top, jug, mid, bot, and sup influence teams’ winning rate. From the above five graphs, we can notice that, besides gold efficiency and vision control, KDA and first blood rate is important to players. To summarize, to help team win a game, the most crucial thing for a player is to farm well and get a higher KDA. If all five players can have a better gold efficiency and higher KDA, their team is one step away from victory. 5.6 Correlation of Different Variables After some analysis of our datasets, we conclude that Higher gold efficiency, better objects control, and more defensive gaming strategy will help a team win a game easier; vision control, however, doesn’t help a lot. One explanation is that every team is good at vision control so that it cannot be an indicator of winning rate. Players’ gold efficiency has direct and positive influence on team’s gold efficiency. Besides gold efficiency, even though vision control does not help team a lot, players should farm well and still controls it’s line’s vision to get a better wining rate. When analyzing our datasets, we noticed some other interesting points. Let’s take a look at the following graph. If we can have better gold efficiency, we will control more visions and kill more towers. With better vision controls and more towers killed, we will control more Dragons and more Nash Barons. As a result, we will have a higher probability to win.

As one of the hottest e-sports events, it attracted millions of watchers around the world. There were even more than 70 million people watching League of Legends World Championship 2021 finals online at the same time. According to official statistics from Riot company, there are more than 8 million players on LOL every day. For each game, people concerns most about final results: victory or defeat. Usually fans will judge win or loss based only on player’s operations. However, in our project, we tried to use data to explain wining rate of different teams. According to game mechanisms, we set up four aspects to study how different variables of teams or players impact winning rate. However, due to human instability, the results predicted by data might be incorrect sometimes. But through data, we can indeed discover some rules and winning traits, which are reasons why teams are always equipped with good data analysts. In our project, owing to time constraints, we only analyzed League of Legends World Championship 2021. The total number of games considered is relatively small, and ban/pick, champion matching, and restraint, are not considered this time. They might be good indicators as well for analyzing winning rate. In addition, professional players and normal players are different. The conclusions we got are only applicable to professional competitions. If we want to understand how to win in daily games, we need to analyze other data separately.
