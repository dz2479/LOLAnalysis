## Description
In this final project, we would like to perform an exploratory data analysis on 2020 LPL summer series. LPL is league of Legends Pro League in China. The summer series is to pick up four candidate for the world series. So we are curious about：

1. Are there any different battle tactics between participating teams? If do exist various styles, we want to use different parameters based on our understandings of LOL to roughly analyze which battle strategies are more likely to win.
2. How do players’ performance contribute to teams’ win rate? In LOL, there are five lines: top, mid, ADC, support and jungle. We will analyze if there is a correlation between players strength and teams’ win rate, and we will also analyze which lines are more important to a win. 
3. How important are resources to a win? There are different types of resources in a game including towers, dragons, and Baron Nashor. Each resource serves different effects. We want to analyze teams’ efficiency of controlling resources and using resources, and how that efficiency contribute to a win.
