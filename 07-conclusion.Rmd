# Conclusion

***League of Legends World Championship 2021*** has finished successfully. As one of the hottest e-sports events, it attracted millions of watchers around the world. There were even more than 70 million people watching ***League of Legends World Championship 2021*** finals online at the same time. According to official statistics from Riot company, there are more than 8 million players on LOL every day.

For each game, people concerns most about final results: victory or defeat. Usually fans will judge win or loss based only on playerâ€™s operations. However, in our project, we tried to use data to explain wining rate of different teams. According to game mechanisms, we set up four aspects to study how different variables of teams or players impact winning rate. However, due to human instability, the results predicted by data might be incorrect sometimes. But through data, we can indeed discover some rules and winning traits, which are reasons why teams are always equipped with good data analysts.

In our project, owing to time constraints, we only analyzed ***League of Legends World Championship 2021***. The total number of games considered is relatively small, and ban/pick, champion matching, and restraint, are not considered this time. They might be good indicators as well for analyzing winning rate. In addition, professional players and normal players are different. The conclusions we got are only applicable to professional competitions. If we want to understand how to win in daily games, we need to analyze other data separately.
